# TicTacToePlus
Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. TicTacToePlus is an evolution of the classic game: you can decide the number of players, the grid size and the tic tac toe number.
There are different modes: you can play in multiplayer in a classic or in a custom game setup and you can play in single-player with two different difficult levels.

TicTacToePlus is fast and powerful in big grids using multithreading tic tac toe checkers (Maybe multitreading is useless in this case, but this code can be used in matrix analysis).
I implemented the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller), but at the moment there isn't a GUI, but only a CLI.
